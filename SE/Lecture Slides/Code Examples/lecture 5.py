# We can also itterate over dictionaries and get both keys and values

# Here is an alternative example
# In this case our temp variable will ALWAYS take on the value of the key
# This will only itterate over keys, however, we can then use that same key
# to access a value in our dictionary
for key in my_dictionary:

# exist
